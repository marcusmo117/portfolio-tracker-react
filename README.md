# Portfolio Tracker App 

## Introduction

Portfolio Tracker App is a personal app that allows users to search for stocks (only US at the moment). Users can sign up and keep track of stocks that theyâ€™ve bought. Holdings are then calculated against current prices and relevant allocations can be viewed as well. Think Yahoo Finance but with added functionalities!
